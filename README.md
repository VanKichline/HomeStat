# Home Status Appliance for Omega2
A simple shell script system to monitor the wifi gateway,
internet access, and A/C power.  Interruptions are logged
and a web page is generated to display the results.

Should run on Omega2 as well as Omega2+.
Initialize the script in rc.local.  Include final " &".
